# Test-Automation---Cookie-Handling---TestNG---Selenium---Maven-Project
Why Handle Cookies in Selenium? Each cookie is associated with a name, value, domain, path, expiry, and the status of whether it is secure or not. In order to validate a client, a server parses all of these values in a cookie.  When Testing a web application using selenium web driver, you may need to create, update or delete a cookie.
